# PasswordAuthenticator

This is a simple password authentication program. The user will be asked for  
a password twice. The password will be rejected if the two entries do not match  
and if it does not contain at least one number.

The user will be notified if the password was rejected or if it was created.

All password entered by the user will be written to a `password.txt` file.
